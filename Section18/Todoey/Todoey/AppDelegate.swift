/*
 Add following code to end of your AppDelegate.swift file but have to be outside of AppDelegate class not inside.
 
 Locate line "newObject!["date"] = Date()" in migrateRealm method in AppDelegate extension and change "date" to name of your property in
 your Item class for example, mine is @objc dynamic var date : Date = Date() so in [] I give "date", if yours is
 like @objc dynamic var dateCreated : Date = Date() then you give "dateCreated" in []. Doing so is basically setting
 a new created current date object to realm database during migration process.
 
 In your todo item view controller class you replace line "let realm = try! Realm()" to "let realm = AppDelegate.getRealm()"
 and do the same thing to category view controller. Note. we have made an extened static method getRealm() to AppDelegate so we can just call it from AppDelegate.
 
 Remember to change your Item model class to have date property
 
 Note. Whenever you modify your model for example, in Item.swift or Category.swift. you have to change schema version which is
 grater than old version, defaul schema version when create Realm is 0.
